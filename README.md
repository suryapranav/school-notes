# The Notes:
These are surya's (and others') notes- all in markdown files, take if you want!

The raw files and material is in the "Repository management stuff" folder, along with logs of everyones contributions and subject-wise segeregation.

The revision timetable and class timetable are also available. However, the class timetable is missing extra classes from 0800 to 0900 in the morning and from 1430 to 1530 in the evening.

More stuff is always being added, and it is appreciated if you can send more notes!

## Intended use:
### If you are familiar with using git:
Clone the repository (```git clone https://github.com/suryapranav/school-notes```) and open the school-notes folder as a vault using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view everything- like the embedded images, PDFs, etc. (Otherwise, look into the "Repository management stuff" folder for the raw files.)

### Beginner's guide (if you are not familiar with using git):
#### Step 1: Cloning the repository:
- Make a GitHub account.
- Download and install [GitHub Deskotp](https://desktop.github.com/).
> Use [this guide](https://dev.to/rahedmir/is-github-desktop-available-for-gnu-linux-4a69#:~:text=Currently%2C%20Github%20Desktop%20for%20GNU,Hat%2FCentOS%2FFedora%20distributions.) to install the app if you're on linux, like I am :)
- Sign into the GitHub Desktop application.
- Click "Clone a repository from the internet"
- In the "URL" section of the popup enter "https://github.org/suryapranav/school-notes " (without the quotation marks.)
- The repository will be cloned, by default, to ```C:\Users\[your username]\Documents\GitHub\school-notes.```
> (This will be ```/home/[your username]/documents/GitHub/school-notes``` if you're on linux.)
#### Step 2: Opening the repository using Obsidian:
- Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- Once Obsidian opens, click on "Open folder as vault"
- In the popup that opens, navigate to the school-notes (mentioned in the pervious steps) **do not go *inside* the folder.**
- Click on the school-notes folder and click on "Open".
- That's it! you now have access to the hard work of the best of 10A along with notes on pretty much every important topic!
- If any new notes are added to the online repository, you can open GitHub desktop and press ```Ctrl + Shift + P``` to update the local repository.

### Incomplete and handwritten notes:
- There are currently `4` topics in need of completion.
- There are currently `6` topics that have handwritten content (with varying degree of readability).

## To-do (inputs/feedback appreciated):
- Collect __all of the notes.__
- Create a system to make embedded files and such accessible without Obsidian, and in the GitHub website itself.
- Transcribe notes tagged "#handwritten"

Happy preparing!

Surya.
